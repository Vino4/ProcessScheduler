The directory tree against which you can test your implementation is rooted
at the directory named "files".  The directory names and file names in the tree
have been generated using a random number generator.

The following command lines assume that the fileCrawler executable
and P*.out are contained in the current working directory.  If no output
results from execution of a particular command, then your program
is generating the correct output.

./fileCrawler '*' files | diff - P1.out
./fileCrawler '*.c' files | diff - P2.out
./fileCrawler '*.[ch]' files | diff - P3.out
./fileCrawler 'a?*.java' files | diff - P4.out
./fileCrawler '???????' files | diff - P5.out
